Scala C-Parser
==============

A clean and simple parser for the C language for Scala.

Currently under development.

Why: There are not many ways to parse C source code from Java/Scala.
Eclipse CDT can be used [(see here)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10737205/using-eclipse-cdt-parser-outside-of-cdt)
but it comes with major dependencies and has an unwieldy API.
